# 3DFoS

Minimal PTv3 / LitePT inference for forestry application, inspired by [sonata](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sonata) standalone.

## What it does

This tool takes raw ground-based forest point clouds and performs semantic segmentation into four classes:

- **Ground:** Soil, leaf litter, and low-lying topography.
- **Understorey:** Shrubs, saplings, and other understorey elements.
- **Stems:** Main trunk architecture.
- **Canopy:** foliage and branches.

It's available in 3 flavors: CLI, Standalone GUI and CloudCompare plugin.

## Key Features

- **Performance:** Powered by the **Point Transformer V3 (PTV3)** architecture, the top performer in our 2026 benchmark among other state-of-the-art 3D deep learning architectures: [PointNeXt](https://github.com/guochengqian/openpoints), [SuperPoint Transformer](https://github.com/drprojects/superpoint_transformer) and [OA-CNN](https://github.com/pointcept/pointcept) (paper coming soon!). We additionally provide a lighter model based on [LitePT-S](https://litept.github.io) for even faster and resource-friendly inference.
- **High-Resolution:** Optimized at a **0.05 m voxel resolution**, allowing for the detection of thin stems and complex understorey textures.
- **Pre-Trained:** The underlying weights were trained on [SegmentedForests](https://doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpaf062), a heterogeneous dataset of 14 plots, covering both **coniferous and broadleaf** stands across various maturity stages, as well as both **TLS** and **MLS** point clouds.
- **(Near) Zero-Setup Inference:** A simple [uv setup](##Installation) is available with a pre-compiled executable and CC plugin coming soon.

Please cite [PointCept](https://github.com/pointcept/pointcept), [PTV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10035) and [Sonata](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sonata) if you use this work (see PointCept for details).

## Changes vs Sonata standalone:

- Added a "clean" `uv` packaging
- Removed `torch_scatter` dependencies (replaced scatter from `PYG` by pure `torch` calls, simplify dependencies).
- Replaced `spconv` by `Torchsparse++` / `nanoTSparse` for sparse convolution. `nanoTSparse` is not affected by `CUMM` bugs (like https://github.com/FindDefinition/cumm/issues/26) and is easier
  to package / maintain. We provide a precompiled version of `nanoTSparse` for CPU. For `CUDA` you need a `C/C++` and `CUDA` compiler/SDK.
- Use `torch` built-in `SDPA` \ `varlen` to levrage efficient and memory friendly attention kernels and remove the need of `flash-attn` dependency. torch `varlen` is only compatible with NVIDIA GPU that have a compute capability of 8.6+ (Ampere arch).
- Added a dedicated inference CLI, GUI and CloudCompare Python Plugin.

## Installation

### Pure CPU inference

Simply with `pip`, in a dedicated `venv`

```
python -m pip install "3dfos[cpu,gui] @ git+https://github.com/3DFin/3DFos.git"
```

Or clone the repo and use `uv` / `pip`

```
git clone git+https://github.com/3DFin/3DFos.git
cd 3DFos
uv sync --extra cpu --extra gui
```

### CUDA/GPU

Two versions of CUDA are supported: 12.8 (cu128) and 13.0 (cu130).

```
uv sync --extra cu130
```

then

```
uv sync --extra cu130 --extra nanotsparsecuda
```

If needed (previous version of `nanoTSparse` / `3DFos` installed) you can force full clean recompilation of `nanoTSparse`.

```
uv sync --extra cu130 --extra nanotsparsecuda --no-cache --reinstall-package nanotsparse
```

on Windows system, it might be necessary to set `DISTUTILS_USE_SDK` env variable in order to compile `nanoTSparse`.

i.e on `Windows Developer PowerShell` terminal session.

```
$env:DISTUTILS_USE_SDK = 1
uv sync --extra cu130 --extra nanotsparsecuda
```

### CloudCompare plugin

refer to the dedicated [section](doc/install_cloudcompare.md).

## Usage

### CLI

```
uv run 3DFos <path_to_the_cloud.las|ply> [--output_path seg_result.las] [--model_path model.ckpt] [--grid_size 0.05] [--model ptv3_full | litept_full] [--device cuda | cpu]
```

### Standalone with GUI

Ensure 3DFos is installed with `gui` extra, then run

```
uv run 3DFos-gui
```

An [example point cloud](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dexdy0uVf58Nh7TfX1srp9FMJ9HrrxME/view?usp=sharing) is available from the 3DFin tutorial.

`model_path` flag is optional and latest weights are automatically downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/3DFin/3DFos/releases) on Github.

Point clouds can be either in `las`/`laz` or `ply` format.

Weights for PTV3 and LitePT trained at a 0.05 m voxel size with and without full `3DFin` features (i.e., distance to axis and elevation) are publicly available. This means that for models with full `3DFin` features, you **must** first run `3DFin` on your point cloud and then provide its output to `3DFos`. For `Z0` only models, you can compute height normalization with `3DFin` or any other software (e.g., vanilla `CSF`). Normal features are always computed on the fly by `3DFos` using `pgeof`.

3DFos looks for additional features by name in `las` files, `ply` files, and CloudCompare scalar fields. Scalar fields in `ply` files must be prefixed by `Scalar_` to match CloudCompare's output format.

You can adapt the voxel size. For example, you could run inference at a 0.1 m voxel size for a model trained at 0.05 m to lower runtime and resource consumption, at the cost of slightly reduced accuracy of the results.

## Funding

3DFos has been developed at the Centre of Wildfire Research of Swansea University (UK) in collaboration with the Research Institute of Biodiversity (CSIC, Spain) and the Department of Mining Exploitation of the University of Oviedo (Spain).

Funding provided by the UK NERC project (NE/T001194/1):

'Advancing 3D Fuel Mapping for Wildfire Behaviour and Risk Mitigation Modelling'

and by the Spanish Knowledge Generation project (PID2021-126790NB-I00):

‘Advancing carbon emission estimations from wildfires applying artificial intelligence to 3D terrestrial point clouds’.

## TODOs:

- Provide a pixi file in order to simplify installation / compilation for CUDA +
- Use point closest to the voxel center for better accuracy.
- Add a `better` spatial tiling mechanism: (First pass of a Lite NN `binary seg` + PCA and morphological operation to extract overlapping tiles + multiple inference + Logit average between tiles)
